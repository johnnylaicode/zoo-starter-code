      The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 
      It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
      It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
      A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
      The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, 
      the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.
